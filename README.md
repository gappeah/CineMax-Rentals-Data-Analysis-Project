The analysis is performed using Power BI, providing insights into rental patterns, customer behaviour, and inventory management.
* This project aims to utilise the provided database schema to create a realistic business scenario where the following information is extracted and analysed data using MySQL and Power BI.
* The project will answer specific business questions through descriptive, diagnostic, and predictive analysis and present.



## Project Files

- **CineMax Rentals Data Analysis Project.pbix**: This is the main Power BI file containing the analysis and visualizations of the CineMax Rentals data.
  
- **sakila-schema.sql**: SQL script to create the schema for the Sakila database. This includes the creation of tables, indexes, and relationships necessary for the data analysis.

- **sakila-data.sql**: SQL script to populate the Sakila database with sample data. This data includes information about films, rentals, customers, inventory, and more.

- **sakila.mwb**: MySQL Workbench file containing the entity-relationship (ER) diagram for the Sakila database. This can be used to understand the structure of the database and the relationships between tables.

## Getting Started

To explore the CineMax Rentals Data Analysis Project, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

1. **Power BI Desktop**: Download and install Power BI Desktop to open and interact with the `.pbix` file.
2. **MySQL Server**: Install MySQL Server to create the Sakila database and import the data.
3. **MySQL Workbench**: (Optional) Use MySQL Workbench to view the ER diagram and manage the database.

### Setting Up the Database

1. **Create the Sakila Database Schema**:
   - Open the `sakila-schema.sql` file in MySQL Workbench or another SQL client.
   - Execute the script to create the database schema.

2. **Import the Sample Data**:
   - Open the `sakila-data.sql` file in MySQL Workbench or another SQL client.
   - Execute the script to populate the database with sample data.

### Using the Power BI File

1. Open the `CineMax Rentals Data Analysis Project.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop.
2. The data should already be connected and loaded from the Sakila database.
3. Explore the various dashboards, reports, and visualizations to gain insights into the rental business.

### MySQL Workbench

- The `sakila.mwb` file can be opened using MySQL Workbench. This provides a visual representation of the database schema, helping you to understand the relationships and structure of the data.
